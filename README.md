# CoreyStewartCampaign


Corey Stewart is a political candidate for Virginia Senator. I worked closely with  people in his campaign to create a weekly report template on the candidate's performance on Twitter and Google.
using Text Mining techniques on political tweets relating the the candidate and his opposition, and incorporating  data avialable on google trends, I sought to offer insights on what people are saying about the race and identify twitter accounts that were the most vocal, either for my candidate or his opposition.
